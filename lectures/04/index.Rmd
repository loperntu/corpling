## Outline

> 1. Advanced corpus query
> 2. Corpus Annotation
> 3. Annotation tools: Basics



---
## What you've learned so far

- Using existing corpus tools (`Antocont` and `Word Sketch Engine`) to **build** and **query/extract** different linguistic patterns (`concordance`, `collocates`, `keywords`, `n-grams`,... and `congram`, BTW)
- The underlying statistic thinking will be discussed later.

## Outline

1. Advanced corpus query
2. __**Corpus Annotation**__
3. Annotation tools: Basics


---
## Corpus Annotation

- Annotation is widely accepted as a crucial contribution to the benefit a corpus brings, for it enriches the corpus as a source of linguistic information for research and applications.
- It can be defined as the practice/art of adding `interpretative, linguistic, or paralinguistic information` to a digitalized corpus of written and/or spoken data.

## Corpus Annotation
### annotation vs markup

- 
-  We will use the term annotation to refer specifically to linguistic information encoded in the text
  - Non-linguistic information also encoded in markup (meta-data).

Corpus annotation = "interpretative, linguistic information"" added to a corpus


---
## Types of annotation

- Typical case of annotation is **grammatical tagging**, in which a *POS tag* is attached to a word to indicate its grammatical class.

## Corpus Annotation: Tools


- [GATE]()
- [ANNIS/Atomic](http://corpus-tools.org): A web browser-based search and visualization architecture for complex multilayer linguistic corpora with diverse types of annotation. 
- [LOPE.anno](http://140.112.147.121:8001/lope.anno/)

## The winner is ...

- For multiple complext linguistic annotation: **ANNIS**
- For

## GATE

> An infrastructure for developing and deploying software components that process human language. GATE helps scientists and developers in three ways

1. by specifiying an architecture, or organisational structure, for language
processing software; 
2. by providing a framework, or class library, that implements the
architecture and can be used to embed language processing capabilities in diverse applications;
3. by providing a development environment built on top of the framework
made up of convenient graphical tools for developing components

## GATE 

Walk through basic [learning modules](https://gate.ac.uk/demos/developer-videos)

- GATE Developer interface
- Loading and Viewing Documents and Corpus (`language resources`)
- Using `Processing Resources`
- Creating and Loading `Applications` and Runtime Parameters
- `Annotations`
- `Data Stores` and Saving Applications




---
## Lab: Annotation Practice

- Installation
- Interface

---
## Loading, Setting and Viewing

- load document into *gate* document.

## Homework (20151030)

- Watch **FutureLearn** (Week4, 4.1-4.10) and write a reflective note.
- (Group work) Design a cross-strait MM-TM historical corpus in political domain
as the data pool for term projects. Present it in the next class.
